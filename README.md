# Interface-Car-Parking

> Code status: Developing ⚠️

## This is an interface created for a Car Parking project.

### The initial interface consists of:

+ login;
+ registration;
+ password recovery.

### After initialization we have a standard interface with a sidebar made up of 5 tabs, which are:

+ "Permanência";
+ "Produtos";
+ "Carrinho";
+ "Contato";
+ "Minha conta".

*The prototype of the system aims to register, and manage the length of stay, the amount to be paid by the car parking user.*

### The tools used to create our interface were:

+ HTML;
+ CSS;
+ a little bit of JavaScript.

### How to run the application:

1. The first step is to download all available files;
2. Second step is to perform the "index.html";
3. And it is done.
